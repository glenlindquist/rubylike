# Rubylike

It's a roguelike. It's written in Ruby and utilizes the [Gosu library](https://github.com/gosu/gosu).

Currently there is not really any gameplay implemented (i.e., no enemies, nothing to do).

Procedurally generated islands w/ my own sorta cellular-automata-esque methodology.

You can walk around the island and pick stuff up. Your beard grows.

Move with arrow keys.

G to get an item.

D to drop an item.

Q to move toward and attack the nearest tree.

S to shave your beard.
